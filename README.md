Ranger:  Warden Kit
Author: Daeros Trollkiller
Version 1
Languages: English
Overview
The Warden is a kit for the ranger class that focuses more on offense than defense and isn’t locked into the “good” side of alignments.  You can think of the warden as the consummate lone wolf woodsman, stalking the forest, and protecting it from outsiders.  Wardens are more aligned with druids in terms of their ethos.  See the kit description below for more details.
The mod package also includes a few new items, some which can be upgraded, and implemented in a way that I think fans of the BG/IWD series will enjoy.
Compatibility
This mod is compatible with the Enhanced Edition versions of Baldur’s Gate(with or without Siege of Dragonspear), Baldur’s Gate 2, Icewind Dale, and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy.  I do not have any plans to incorporate compatibility for non-EE versions at this time.
Note: one of the items is placed in the SoD campaign.  The mod can be fully played without it in BG1, you just wont be able to obtain this item unless you console it in, or use something like EE  Keeper.
Bug Reporting
If you should encounter any bugs, please report them on the mod’s thread in the BeamDog forums, located here.
Installation

Simply copy the contents of the zip file into your games’ folder, then double click on the rgr_warden.exe file to begin installation. 
 
Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG
Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called Modmerge on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

Warden Kit for Ranger
WARDEN: Wardens serve to protect nature from the ravages of civilization, and usually prefer to keep away from large cities and the like.  However, a warden would have no reservations in tracking down a poacher to even those most crowded of places to bring them to justice, whether such action is lawfully warranted or not.  A Warden's first and only true loyalty is to the natural world which they seek to protect, with little or no consideration given to the laws of the civilized world.  Wardens are quite resourceful and use their knowledge of the natural world to stymie the encroachment of "civilized" races into the wild.

New Warden Kit abilities: 
Create Fieldcraft Ammunition
This ability allows the warden to create special ammunition using his or her knowledge of the natural world.  He/She is able to create this ammunition in greater quantities as he/she gains in experience.  Few other than a skilled woodsman would be able to use this ammunition effectively, however.  Furthermore, the compounds used in creating this ammunition, while effective, are also unstable, and if not used within 2 days, will be rendered useless.
 
  1st Level: Creates 2 Arrows/Bolts/Bullets.
  3rd Level: Creates 4 Arrows/Bolts/Bullets.
  6th Level: Creates 6 Arrows/Bolts/Bullets.
  10th Level: Creates 8 Arrows/Bolts/Bullets.
  15th Level: Creates 10 Arrows/Bolts/Bullets.
Electrocution Trap
This clever trap makes use of bio-chemical electrical energy, stored carefully within a fragile makeshift battery of sorts.  When the trap is triggered, the battery explodes, sending electrical currents arcing outward in all directions, striking creatures within a 10-ft radius.
  3rd Level: Deals 1d2 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell is failed.
  8th Level: Deals 1d4 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty is failed.
  13th Level: Deals 1d8 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty is failed.
  18th Level: Deals 1d12 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell with a -6 penalty is failed.
  23rd Level: Deals 1d16 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell with a -8 penalty is failed.
  28th Level: Deals 1d20 electrical damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell with a -10 penalty is failed.
Create Fieldcraft Poultice
With this ability, the warden uses his/her knowledge of the natural world to create a poultice that will help in healing wounds and drawing out toxins.  As he/she gains in level, the efficacy of the poultice created improves.
  1st Level: Heals 8 Hit Points, cures poison and disease.
  7th Level: Heals 22 Hit Points, cures poison and disease.
  15th Level: Heals 31 Hit Points, cures poison and disease.
Burning Web Trap
This devious trap is constructed of sticky web extracts from giant spiders soaked in a highly flammable liquid.  When triggered, it explodes, covering creatures in a 12-ft radius.
 
  7th Level: Deals 1d3 fire damage and slows the target, doing an additional 1 point of fire damage per round for 1 turn if a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty is failed.
  12th Level: Deals 2d3 fire damage and slows the target, doing an additional 1 point of fire damage per round for 1 turn if a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty is failed.
  17th Level: Deals 2d3 fire damage and slows the target, doing an additional 2 points of fire damage per round for 1 turn if a Save vs. Spell with a -6 penalty is failed.
  22nd Level: Deals 3d3 fire damage and slows the target, doing an additional 2 points of fire damage per round for 1 turn if a Save vs. Spell with a -8 penalty is failed.
  27th Level: Deals 3d3 fire damage and slows the target, doing an additional 3 points of fire damage per round for 1 turn if a Save vs. Spell with a -10 penalty is failed.
Parasitic Fungus Trap
When triggered, this heinous trap will release a cloud of parasitic fungal spores into a 15-ft radius surrounding the trap.  These spores quickly infect and spread into affected creatures causing disease and psychological effects unless a successful Save vs Spell is made.  The infection can spread to other creatures within a 10-ft radius, but cannot re-infect creatures already suffering from its effects.
  10th Level: Deals 4d6 magic damage, then 3d6 magic damage the second round, 2d6 magic damage the third round, 1d6 magic damage the fourth round, and causes confusion for the duration if a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty is failed.  If successful, damage is reduced to 2d6, 1d6, and 1d6 respecively, and confusion is negated.
  15th Level: Deals 4d6 magic damage, then 3d6 magic damage the second round, 2d6 magic damage the third round, 1d6 magic damage the fourth round, and causes confusion for the duration if a Save vs. Spell with a -6 penalty is failed.  If successful, damage is reduced to 2d6, 1d6, and 1d6 respecively, and confusion is negated.
  20th Level: Deals 4d6 magic damage, then 3d6 magic damage the second round, 2d6 magic damage the third round, 1d6 magic damage the fourth round, and causes confusion for the duration if a Save vs. Spell with a -8 penalty is failed.  If successful, damage is reduced to 2d6, 1d6, and 1d6 respecively, and confusion is negated.
  25th Level: Deals 4d6 magic damage, then 3d6 magic damage the second round, 2d6 magic damage the third round, 1d6 magic damage the fourth round, and causes confusion for the duration if a Save vs. Spell with a -10 penalty is failed.  If successful, damage is reduced to 2d6, 1d6, and 1d6 respecively, and confusion is negated.
  30th Level: Deals 4d6 magic damage, then 3d6 magic damage the second round, 2d6 magic damage the third round, 1d6 magic damage the fourth round, and causes confusion for the duration if a Save vs. Spell with a -12 penalty is failed.  If successful, damage is reduced to 2d6, 1d6, and 1d6 respecively, and confusion is negated.
